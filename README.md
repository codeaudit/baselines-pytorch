# baselines-pytorch
RL baselines using Pytorch.

Currently implemented:
 - A2C - as described in [Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783v1.pdf) and [OpenAI's blog post](https://blog.openai.com/baselines-acktr-a2c/) for the synchronous varient.

Implementation took inspiration from:
[OpenAI/baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines and [ikostrikov/pytorch-a3c](https://github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-a3c).
